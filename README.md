## Widget.jar

This is a little widget based on Java 17 and Java FX. It contains just four links to popular websites, which will be  
called by clicking one of the buttons. To run it, a Java Runtime Environment is necessary. Java FX Dependencies are  
already included in the jar, so it should run also without Java FX on the local machine. To stop the widget, click  
the big X on the right side for closing it.
